	Attributes - Define tile's properties. Can be passive (eg. medic heal or Toughness) or active (eg. warrior's attack or HQ's Mobility). Help with managing new Armies additions (just create new attributes and add them to new tiles). Can work on self or others attached to the unit that has it.
	
	
	
Battle:
	When invoked the game should automatically calculate all the damage accounting for different bonuses (from Modules, HQs, passive Attributes, etc.) and also ask the player to make a choice in certain situations (eg. Medic taking damage for a unit between 2 different sources)
